# base router react

in this proyect I use method createHashRouter in AppRouter, this when you need serv in /other path 
but you can use createBrowserRouter when you need use root path /

the result when you build, if you use createHashRouter, you need to change href or src of "/" to "./" or "" notingh.

with react router dom

install
```bash
yarn
```

run
```bash
yarn run dev
```

build
```bash
yarn run build
```
